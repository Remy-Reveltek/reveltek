# Subject: Focus App Policy for Remote Workplace - Use of Focus App and Communication Protocols

## Policy! 

As we continue to work remotely, we want to ensure that our communication and productivity are not hindered in any way. With that in mind, we introduced a policy that mandates the use of the Focus App as soon as you clock in with MS Shift, and to follow certain communication protocols during your workday.

Effective immediately, it is mandatory for all employees to turn on the Focus App as soon as they clock in with MS Shift. The Focus App helps you stay on track and focused by blocking distracting websites and apps during your work hours. This will help you be more productive and efficient with your time.

In addition to using the Focus App, we also want to emphasize the importance of communication with your peers. Please make sure to communicate in the chat about the progress you are making throughout the day. This will help your team stay informed about the progress of each project and keep everyone on the same page.

Furthermore, we require that you give a summary of your work progress before you end your work shift. This will help your team stay updated about the progress of the project and avoid any delays in project completion.

### It is important to note that failure to follow these steps will result in the employee being marked as unexcused leave for that specific day and a deduction in salary for that day.

We understand that these measures may take some time to get used to, but we believe that they will ultimately help us all work together more efficiently and effectively. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to HR.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to making our remote workplace a success.
